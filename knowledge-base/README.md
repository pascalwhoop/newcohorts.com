## Core Concepts

### Cohort Model

**Definition:** A fixed group of people who meet consistently (weekly) over a defined period (6 weeks) to build relationships through intentional, varied experiences.

**Why It Works:**
1. **Repeated exposure** → Creates familiarity and trust
2. **Shared experiences** → Builds emotional bonds
3. **Consistency** → Removes decision friction (same time, same people)
4. **Intentionality** → Activities are designed to deepen connection, not just pass time

**Evidence Base:**
- University cohorts produce lifelong friendships
- Bootcamp cohorts bond intensely
- Church groups, mastermind groups all use cohort model
- Research on friendship: ~200+ hours of time together needed for close friendship

**Historical Precedent:**
- Medieval guilds used cohort learning
- Masonic lodges use cohort-based initiation
- Summer camps, school cohorts, military units all leverage this

### 6-Week Program Structure

**Week 1: Kickoff**
- Goal: Introductions, set tone, initial bonding
- Activity: Group dinner at casual restaurant
- Dynamic: Low-pressure, get-to-know-you format
- Social mechanism: Novelty (new experience) + comfort (familiar setting)

**Week 2: Creative**
- Goal: Hands-on bonding through novel activity
- Activity: Pottery, painting, cocktail-making class
- Dynamic: Collaborative without being forced
- Social mechanism: Parallel activity (less pressure than face-to-face) + creative expression

**Week 3: Active/Playful**
- Goal: Break ice, generate shared humor
- Activity: Bowling, mini golf, board game cafe
- Dynamic: Low-stakes competition, lots of laughing
- Social mechanism: Laughter and play (oxytocin-inducing)

**Week 4: Exploratory**
- Goal: Discover Amsterdam together
- Activity: Neighborhood walking tour, food market crawl, museum + coffee
- Dynamic: Learning together as peers
- Social mechanism: Shared discovery + local knowledge building

**Week 5: Collaborative**
- Goal: Teamwork creates inside jokes and bonding
- Activity: Escape room, cooking class, pub quiz, improv workshop
- Dynamic: Cooperation under mild pressure
- Social mechanism: Collective problem-solving, inside jokes form here

**Week 6: Reflection & Celebration**
- Goal: Celebrate completion, commit to ongoing contact
- Activity: Picnic in park, potluck, drinks at cozy bar
- Dynamic: Reflection on journey + future planning
- Social mechanism: Closure + commitment to continue

**Total Investment:** ~€60-100 per person across 6 weeks (€10-20/week)

### The Problem We Solve

**Magnitude:** Loneliness in new cities is massive and underserved
- 1.2M people relocate within Netherlands annually
- ~30% report significant loneliness in first year
- Amsterdam: ~90k arrivals/year (expats + internal migration)

**Why Existing Solutions Fail:**
- **Apps (Bumble, Peanut):** Transactional, no consistency, no structure
- **Meetups:** Too loose, high flakiness, shallow connections
- **Co-living:** Too expensive, not accessible to most
- **Work friends:** Not always available, not chosen peer group

**What People Actually Need:**
- Consistency (same people, same time)
- Intentionality (activities designed for bonding, not just networking)
- Low friction (don't have to organize, just show up)
- Legitimacy (feels real, not like a scheme or corporate team-building)

### Key Success Factors

1. **Group Size:** 12-18 people per cohort (sweet spot)
   - Below 10: Feels too intimate, pressure
   - Above 20: Too diffuse, subgroups form

2. **Attendance:** 80%+ attendance across 6 weeks (critical threshold)
   - If people drop, group dynamic collapses
   - Mitigation: Pre-screening + deposit system + explicit commitment asks

3. **Facilitator Quality:** 1-2 trained facilitators per cohort
   - Not there to be "friends" but to hold space
   - Responsibilities: logistics, tone-setting, inclusion, problem-solving
   - Cannot scale without systems & training

4. **Activity Design:** Mix of energy levels and interaction types
   - Week 1: Low pressure (dinner)
   - Week 2: Hands-on (pottery)
   - Week 3: Playful (bowling)
   - Week 4: Exploratory (walking tour)
   - Week 5: Collaborative (escape room)
   - Week 6: Reflective (celebration)

5. **Clear Commitment Asks:** Written expectations upfront
   - All 6 weeks (no drop-ins)
   - Weekly 2-3 hour commitment
   - Active participation (not just attendance)

## Operational Guides

### Activity Planning

**Selection Criteria:**
- ✓ Novel enough to be interesting, not so novel as to be scary
- ✓ Allows conversation/observation (not TV-watching)
- ✓ Accessible (cost, mobility, skill level)
- ✓ Mixed group-friendly (no gender-exclusive, not exclusionary)
- ✗ Avoid: High-pressure activities early, extreme sports, anything feeling "corporate team-building"

**Booking & Logistics:**
1. Book venues 2-3 weeks in advance
2. Confirm capacity for your group size
3. Share details with participants 1 week before
4. Ask for dietary restrictions, accessibility needs
5. Send reminder 24 hours before

**Budget Target:** €10-20 per person per activity
- Week 1 dinner: €15-20 (catering)
- Week 2 pottery: €15-20 (class fee)
- Week 3 bowling: €10-15
- Week 4 walking tour: €0-10
- Week 5 escape room: €15-25
- Week 6 picnic: €5-10 (bring-your-own)

### Recruitment Strategy

**Phase 1: Pre-Recruitment (Before website)** - 1 week
- Identify recruitment channels
- Join Amsterdam expat Facebook groups
- Follow relevant Reddit communities
- Research Discord servers
- Identify 5-10 partner organizations

**Phase 2: Content Creation** - 1 week
- Write core problem-solution narrative (300 words)
- Create 3 channel-specific variations
  - Reddit: Raw, honest, problem-focused
  - Facebook: Warm, community-focused
  - Instagram: Visual, emotional, story-focused
- Be authentic about it being a pilot

**Phase 3: Distribution** - 2 weeks
- Post across all identified channels
- Ask friends to share
- Optionally: €50-100 Instagram/Facebook ads test
- Email personal networks

**Phase 4: Conversion** - 1 week
- Landing page + email signup
- Follow-up sequence explaining cohort details
- Onboarding call (optional but recommended for high-touch)
- WhatsApp group creation

**Goal:** 12 signups minimum (to hit 10 attendance target); 20+ ideal

### Facilitator Responsibilities

**Before Cohort:**
- [ ] Confirm final participant list and contact info
- [ ] Create WhatsApp group + intro welcome message
- [ ] Send cohort expectations email (commitment, attendance policy, what to expect)
- [ ] Collect dietary restrictions, accessibility needs, photo permissions
- [ ] Book all 6 weeks of activities in advance
- [ ] Create facilitator prep sheet for each week

**During Cohort (Each Week):**
- [ ] Arrive 15 min early to set up/greet
- [ ] Actively facilitate (introduce icebreakers week 1-2, guide conversations, manage group dynamics)
- [ ] Take observational notes (who's bonding, who's shy, group dynamics)
- [ ] Stay through end, help with logistics
- [ ] Send post-activity message to group (photo, gratitude, teaser for next week)

**Mid-Cohort (Week 3):**
- [ ] Pulse survey: How's it going? What's working? Any issues?
- [ ] Address any concerns immediately
- [ ] Private check-in with anyone seeming isolated

**After Cohort:**
- [ ] Exit survey: Friendship formation, willingness to pay, recommendations
- [ ] Document learnings (what worked, what didn't, what surprised you)
- [ ] Share results with co-founders
- [ ] Plan Cohort 2 improvements

2. **Career Relocator** (higher budget, loyal)
3. **Life Transitioner** (highest emotional need)
4. **Remote Worker** (medium urgency)
5. **Local Seeking Refresh** (lowest urgency, but valuable for inclusivity)

### Market Validation

**Amsterdam Addressable Market:**
- ~90,000 arrivals/year (expats + internal migrants)
- ~30% report loneliness (27,000 potential customers)
- Serviceable market: 1,000-2,000 signups in Year 1 (ambitious but achievable)

**Pricing Validation:**
- Customer research: €80-150 price range acceptable
- Chosen price: €120 (€20/week for 6 weeks)
- Rationale: Covers costs, creates commitment filter, builds sustainable margins

**Competitive Moat:**
- Network effects: Past cohort members recruit friends
- Brand: "The trusted way to make friends in Amsterdam"
- Facilitator expertise: Hard to replicate good facilitation
- Note: Easy to copy model, so speed and brand matter
