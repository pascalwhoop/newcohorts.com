**Prompt Title:** Layered Community Growth

**Description:** An illustration showing growth and depth in community. Start with a few core, interlocking shapes at the center (in `Forest Green`). Around this core, layers of new, slightly lighter-toned shapes (e.g., `Faded Ink` or `Sand`) are added, loosely connected but clearly part of the expanding group. The hand-drawn style gives a sense of organic expansion. The background is `Paper White`, with a very light, almost transparent `Clay Orange` wash around the edges of the central core, symbolizing warmth radiating outwards. This visual conveys the idea of a developing and growing community.
