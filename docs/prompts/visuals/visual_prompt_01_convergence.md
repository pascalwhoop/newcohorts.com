**Prompt Title:** Abstract Human Convergence

**Description:** A clean, minimalistic illustration depicting several distinct, abstract human-like shapes (e.g., imperfect, rounded figures reminiscent of pebbles or stylized avatars) in `Charcoal Ink` or `Faded Ink` on a `Paper White` background. These individual shapes are initially scattered, then shown in motion, gently moving towards a central point. The style is hand-drawn with slightly uneven, organic lines to convey a tactile, human touch. The overall composition should feel warm, inviting, and suggest the beginning of a gathering.

**Keywords:** Abstract, hand-drawn, human shapes, convergence, gathering, minimalist, warm, inviting, organic, new connections, community, `Charcoal Ink`, `Faded Ink`, `Paper White`.
