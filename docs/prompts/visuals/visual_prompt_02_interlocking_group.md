**Prompt Title:** Interlocking Cohort Formation

**Description:** An illustration showcasing the abstract shapes from the previous prompt (imperfect, rounded figures in `Charcoal Ink` or `Faded Ink`) now interlocked and seamlessly fitted together to form a larger, stable, and cohesive group. The interlocking points should have subtle accents of `Clay Orange` or `Forest Green`, symbolizing the spark of connection and support within the cohort. The hand-drawn style with a soft, natural texture (like paper or canvas overlay) is maintained. The overall feeling should be one of belonging, strength in numbers, and authentic community.

**Keywords:** Abstract, hand-drawn, interlocking, cohesion, community, cohort formation, supportive group, belonging, stable, `Charcoal Ink`, `Faded Ink`, `Clay Orange`, `Forest Green`, `Paper White`, tactile, textured.
