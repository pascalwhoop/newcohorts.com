**Prompt Title:** Simple Organic Network

**Description:** A minimalist visual representing a network of connected, organic shapes. Each node in the network is a soft, rounded, slightly imperfect shape (in `Charcoal Ink` or `Faded Ink`), and they are linked by thin, hand-drawn lines (also in `Charcoal Ink` or `Faded Ink`). The overall structure should feel naturally grown, not rigid or digital. There are small, subtle highlights or points of interest (e.g., tiny dots or a slight color shift to `Clay Orange`) at some connection points, implying strong bonds. The background is a clean `Paper White`.

**Keywords:** Minimalist, organic network, hand-drawn, connected shapes, natural growth, subtle highlights, strong bonds, `Charcoal Ink`, `Faded Ink`, `Clay Orange`, `Paper White`.
