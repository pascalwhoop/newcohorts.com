# New Cohorts - Target Customer Personas

## Primary Persona: The New Arrival

### Profile
- **Name:** Maya (or similar)
- **Age:** 27
- **Background:** Just moved to Amsterdam 2 months ago for a job in tech/consulting
- **Location:** Renting an apartment, knows neighborhood but not much else
- **Income:** €3,500-5,500/month (mid-level professional)

### The Problem
- Recently arrived and has 0-5 close friends in the city
- Apps like Bumble BFF and Peanut feel transactional and unreliable
- Attended a few Meetup events but conversations felt shallow
- Working 8-9 hours/day; exhausted from onboarding to new job
- Friends back home feel far away; feels lonely despite being in a big city
- Has weekends free but doesn't know what to do or who to do it with
- Wants to build a real social circle, not just collect acquaintances

### Motivations
- **Emotional:** Relief from loneliness, sense of belonging, being known
- **Social:** Part of a friend group, have weekend plans, feel integrated
- **Practical:** Learn city secrets, get local recommendations, explore efficiently
- **Identity:** "I'm building a life in Amsterdam" (not just temporarily passing through)

### Behaviors & Timeline
**Pre-joining:**
- Searches: "making friends Amsterdam expat," "new in Amsterdam where to go," "expat groups Amsterdam"
- Hangs: Reddit (r/Amsterdam), Facebook expat groups, Instagram location tags
- Listens to: Friends' stories about their moves; podcasts about friendship & loneliness
- Research phase: 2-4 weeks of exploring options before committing

**Decision Drivers:**
- Credibility of facilitators (are they real, do they get it?)
- Social proof (other reviews, Instagram comments from past cohort members)
- Clarity of commitment (weekly at same time = makes it easy to say yes)
- Price point (€120 for 6 weeks feels like small risk for potential big reward)

### Concerns
- "Will people flake out?"
- "Will it be awkward?"
- "Is this a pyramid scheme or scam?"
- "What if I don't connect with the group?"
- "Will I have to do trust falls and icebreakers?" (wants genuine, not forced)

### Likelihood to Join
**Very High** if:
- Website feels trustworthy and authentic
- Can commit to all 6 weeks
- Sees other people like them joining
- Activities appeal (not too niche, not too generic)

- **Background:** Moved with spouse for corporate assignment or startup opportunity

- **Income:** €4,000-7,000/month

### The Problem

- Doesn't want to make separate solo social plans (feels excluding)
- International assignment typically 2-4 year duration (needs real friends, not transient)

- **Situation:** Intentionally moved to Amsterdam for fresh start
- **Income:** €3,000-5,500/month

### The Problem
- Lost primary social circle with relationship (friends were "couple friends")
- Feels shame/awkwardness returning to old friend groups as single person
- Wants to rebuild identity separate from old life
- Has time and motivation but fragile confidence

### Why They Join

- Work doesn't provide social network (no office, no colleagues nearby)
- Co-working spaces provide desk mates, not friends
- Can feel isolated despite choosing the lifestyle
- Has time (can work flexible hours) but needs accountability for social investment
