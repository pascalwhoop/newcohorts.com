# New Cohorts - Vision Document

## Core Mission

Build lasting community and friendships for relocated people in Amsterdam through consistent,
intentional group experiences.

## The Opportunity

Moving to a new city is an exciting adventure, but finding your crew can be challenging. While there
are countless apps and meetups available, people often struggle to build the kind of deep, lasting
friendships that make a new place feel like home. Existing solutions (Peanut, Bumble BFF, Meetup)
are either superficial, inconsistent, or lack the repeated exposure necessary for genuine
connection.

**The Insight:** Real friendships require consistent time together with the same people over
extended periods. This is exactly how university cohorts work—and they produce some of life's most
enduring bonds.

## The Solution

A **6-week cohort-based friendship program** where the same group meets weekly for varied activities
designed to foster genuine connections.

### Core Mechanics

- **Consistency:** Same group, same time, every week
- **Variety:** Mix of activities (social, creative, cultural, collaborative, active)
- **Intentionality:** Carefully designed experiences that deepen connection
- **Community:** Built on the principle that consistent togetherness creates lasting bonds

## Target Personas

### Primary: The New Arrival

- **Age:** Mid-20s to mid-30s
- **Situation:** Recently moved to Amsterdam, excited to build their social network
- **Motivation:** Create meaningful friendships, explore the city, ready for weekly commitment
- **Time availability:** High (new to city, fewer existing commitments)

### Secondary Personas

- **Career relocators:** Moved with spouse for work, spouse has colleagues but they're looking for
  their own crew
- **Life transitioners:** Recently single, ready to build new friend groups
- **Remote workers:** Moved to Amsterdam, work from home, seeking organic social opportunities
- **Locals seeking refresh:** Amsterdam natives wanting to expand their social circles

## Key Differentiators

1. **Forced consistency** - Weekly commitment creates bonding unlike casual apps
2. **Low overhead** - Validates with minimal resources, high word-of-mouth potential
3. **Perfect location** - Amsterdam: international, English-speaking, constant expat influx
4. **Clear outcome** - Not just "making friends" but building a cohort culture

## Strategic Strengths

- **Real opportunity:** Building community in new cities is a massive, underserved need
- **Forced consistency:** Weekly commitment creates bonding conditions that most friendship apps
  lack
- **Low initial investment:** Can validate with almost no money upfront
- **Built-in word-of-mouth:** Successful cohorts become evangelists
- **Amsterdam advantage:** International city, English-speaking, constant influx of expats

## Key Risks & Challenges

- **Chicken-and-egg problem:** Need critical mass for first cohort (25-40 people minimum)
- **Flakiness risk:** People dropping out breaks the model
- **Unclear value proposition:** "Make friends" sounds vague - needs sharper positioning around
  building your crew
- **No moat:** Easy to copy if it works
- **Facilitator burden:** Who runs these? How much time? Does it scale?
- **Monetization unclear:** Don't know yet if or how this makes money

## 6-Week Program Structure

### Week 1: Kickoff & Open Space Planning

- **Activity:** Kickoff & "open space" to develop the peer event agenda. Everyone can propose a
  topic and there will be 3x 25 minutes planning + 1x 30 plenary presentation of the complete
  agenda. Pizza & optional pub crawl afterwards
- **Goal:** Introductions, collaborative planning, set expectations, start building rapport and
  excitement
- **Cost:** Pizza dinner + optional pub crawl (€15-25 per person)

### Week 2: Boat Cruise Adventure

- **Activity:** Boat cruise to explore the city from the water, enjoy a cliché together
- **Goal:** Novel shared experience, see Amsterdam from unique perspective, group bonding
- **Cost:** €20-30 per person

### Week 3: Storytelling Open Mic

- **Activity:** Visit a known venue in Amsterdam for open mic storytelling. People can share their
  stories
- **Goal:** Personal sharing, vulnerability, deeper connections through storytelling
- **Cost:** €5-15 per person (venue dependent)

### Week 4: Group Gym Session

- **Activity:** Visit a great gym in the city for a group wide workout class + optional gym or sauna
  sessions. Given most gym's saunas are gender split, that will be the same here
- **Goal:** Active bonding, health & wellness focus, optional relaxation
- **Cost:** €15-25 per person

### Week 5: City Walking Tour

- **Activity:** Joined walk around the city, visiting markets and cool bakeries and cafés
- **Goal:** Discover Amsterdam together, deeper conversations, local culture exploration
- **Cost:** €0-15 per person

### Week 6: Dinner Safari & Closing Party

- **Activity:** 3 course dinner across multiple people's houses. This is a popular format in German
  university towns and allows for long form conversations with people over dinner while "opening up"
  by letting people visit your home. Joined party at the end
- **Goal:** Reflect on amazing experience, exchange contacts, plan future adventures together,
  intimate home sharing
- **Cost:** €10-20 per person

## Key Validation Questions

### Duration

- Is 6 weeks the right length? Research: How long does it take to form friendships?
- Alternative: 4 weeks (easier commitment) or 8 weeks (deeper bonds)

### Monetization

- Should participants pay? If so, how much?
- Options: €50-100 for 6 weeks? Pay-what-you-can? Free pilot then paid?
- Should it be non-profit with proceeds to charity?
- Could sponsors cover costs (co-working spaces, activity venues)

### Commitment

- How do you ensure people show up?
- Require deposit that's refunded if they attend 5 out of 6 weeks?
- Interview process to filter for serious people?

## Success Definition - Pilot Phase

- **Recruitment:** 12+ signups within 2 weeks
- **Engagement:** 80%+ attendance across 6 weeks
- **Outcomes:** 50%+ form 2+ meaningful friendships; 60%+ plan ongoing adventures together
- **Validation:** 70%+ willing to pay for future cohorts

## Scaling Strategy: From Amsterdam to Global

### Phase 1: Foundation & Validation (Weeks 1-4)

- **Week 1-2:** Build simple website, join recruitment channels
- **Week 2-4:** Content creation and distribution across Amsterdam expat communities
- **Goal:** 12+ signups by 2 weeks before start date (ideal: 20 signups)
- **Focus:** Validate demand and refine messaging

### Phase 2: Pilot Execution (6 weeks)

- Run first cohort with detailed observation and note-taking
- Mid-cohort check-in (week 3): Quick survey
- Exit survey: Would they recommend? What changed?
- Measure: How many formed lasting friendships?
- Ask: Would they pay? How much?
- Document learnings for Cohort 2

### Phase 3: Proof-of-Concept (6-12 months)

- Build repeatable, high-quality cohort model
- Validate unit economics and customer willingness to pay
- Achieve 80%+ success metrics across multiple cohorts
- Document processes, training, and playbooks
- Build brand and word-of-mouth in single city

### Phase 4: Regional Expansion (EU Cities)

- Franchise/partnership model to scale to 10+ European cities
- Each city has trained local operators
- Leverage brand, processes, and learnings from Amsterdam
- Target revenue: €2.2M+ across EU by Year 2-3

### Phase 5: Global Scale

- Expand to 50+ cities globally (similar to Meetup.com, Bumble BFF at scale)
- Platform layer to support operations
- Potential revenue: €15M+ annually
- Become the trusted way for relocated people to build friendships worldwide

## Immediate Next Steps

### Today's Action Items

1. **Decide:** When does Cohort 1 start? (Pick a Monday 4-5 weeks from now)
2. **Assign:** Who builds the website vs. who handles recruitment channels
3. **Set check-in:** Tomorrow same time to review progress

### Week 1-2 Tasks

- **Website:** Single landing page explaining concept, email signup form, sample 6-week schedule
- **Recruitment:** Join Amsterdam expat Facebook groups, Reddit communities, Discord servers,
  Meetup.com
- **Content:** Write compelling post about problem/solution, create 3 variations for different
  platforms

### Competition Research (After 10 signups)

- Analyze: Peanut app, Bumble BFF, Meetup.com, We3 app
- Research: Adult friendship programs in other cities
- Study: Co-living spaces with social programming (Roam, Selina)
- Ask: What do they do well? What's missing? How is our cohort model different?

## Long-term Vision

Build the primary community platform for people relocating to new cities globally. New Cohorts
becomes the trusted, proven way to find your crew and build lasting friendships—starting with
Amsterdam as our anchor market, then scaling to become a global network.
