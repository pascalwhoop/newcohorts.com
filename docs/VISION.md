# New Cohorts - Vision Document

## Core Mission
Build lasting friendships for relocated people in Amsterdam through consistent, intentional group experiences.

## The Problem
Relocating to a new city is isolating. Despite having access to countless apps and meetups, people struggle to form genuine, lasting friendships. Existing solutions (Peanut, Bumble BFF, Meetup) are either superficial, inconsistent, or lack the repeated exposure necessary for deep connection.

**The Insight:** Real friendships require consistent time together with the same people over extended periods. This is exactly how university cohorts work—and they produce some of life's most enduring bonds.

## The Solution
A **6-week cohort-based friendship program** where the same group meets weekly for varied activities designed to foster genuine connections.

### Core Mechanics
- **Consistency:** Same group, same time, every week
- **Variety:** Mix of activities (social, creative, cultural, collaborative, active)
- **Intentionality:** Carefully designed experiences that deepen connection
- **Community:** Built on the principle that consistent togetherness creates lasting bonds

## Target Market
**Primary:** Relocated professionals & expats (ages 25-35) in Amsterdam with minimal social networks

**Secondary:** Life transitioners, remote workers, locals seeking social refresh

## Key Differentiators
1. **Forced consistency** - Weekly commitment creates bonding unlike casual apps
2. **Low overhead** - Validates with minimal resources, high word-of-mouth potential
3. **Perfect location** - Amsterdam: international, English-speaking, constant expat influx
4. **Clear outcome** - Not just "making friends" but building a cohort culture

## Success Definition - Pilot Phase
- **Recruitment:** 12+ signups within 2 weeks
- **Engagement:** 80%+ attendance across 6 weeks
- **Outcomes:** 50%+ form 2+ meaningful friendships; 60%+ plan ongoing contact
- **Validation:** 70%+ willing to pay for future cohorts

## Scaling Strategy: From Amsterdam to Global

### Phase 1: Validation & Proof-of-Concept (Amsterdam)
- Build repeatable, high-quality cohort model
- Validate unit economics and customer willingness to pay
- Achieve 80%+ success metrics across multiple cohorts
- Document processes, training, and playbooks
- Build brand and word-of-mouth in single city
- Timeline: 6-12 months

### Phase 2: Regional Expansion (EU Cities)
- Franchise/partnership model to scale to 10+ European cities
- Each city has trained local operators
- Leverage brand, processes, and learnings from Amsterdam
- Target revenue: €2.2M+ across EU by Year 2-3

### Phase 3: Global Scale
- Expand to 50+ cities globally (similar to Meetup.com, Bumble BFF at scale)
- Platform layer to support operations
- Potential revenue: €15M+ annually
- Become the trusted way for relocated people to build friendships worldwide

## Long-term Vision
Build the primary community platform for people relocating to new cities globally. New Cohorts becomes the trusted, proven way to build lasting friendships—starting with Amsterdam as our anchor market, then scaling to become a global network.
