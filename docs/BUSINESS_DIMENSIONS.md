# New Cohorts - Key Business Dimensions

## 1. Value Proposition

### What We Offer

A structured 6-week friendship program that delivers lasting connections through intentional weekly
experiences with a consistent group.

### Why It Works

- **Psychology:** Repeated exposure + shared activities = Friendship formation
- **Differentiation:** Consistency where other apps are random; intentionality where meetups are
  casual
- **Validation:** Based on proven cohort model (universities, bootcamps, church groups)

### Our Motivation

We're building this because we genuinely believe in the power of meaningful friendships and have
experienced firsthand how difficult it can be to form lasting connections in new cities. While we're
excited about the business opportunity and potential for growth, our primary driver is creating a
solution that actually works for people seeking authentic relationships. The financial projections
and scaling plans reflect our commitment to building something sustainable that can help more
people, not just a quick venture.

## 5. Unit Economics - Per City (Model Applicable to Any City)

_Note: Amsterdam is our pilot validation market. These economics are designed to be repeatable
across cities globally._

### Assumptions

- Price: €200 per person
- Target: 100 people per month (1,200 annually)
- Activity costs: €100 per person per program
- Facilitator time: 10 hrs/cohort @ €30/hr = €300
- Affiliate revenue: €100 per person annually
- Follow-up membership: €2/month, 50% conversion rate

| **Net monthly profit**         | **€8,000** |

### Annual Economics (1,200 people)

| Metric                         | Value       |
| ------------------------------ | ----------- |
| Revenue (1,200 × €200)         | €240,000    |
| Activity costs (1,200 × €100)  | €120,000    |
| Facilitation (480 hrs × €30)   | €14,400     |
| Overhead (venue, comms, admin) | €9,600      |
| **Net annual profit**          | **€96,000** |

### Affiliate Revenue (Additional)

## 6. Key Risks & Mitigation

| Risk                           | Impact                        | Mitigation                                          |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chicken-egg (low signups)**  | Low revenue, unviable cohorts | Paid acquisition test + partnerships + content      |
| **Flakiness (low attendance)** | Breaks model                  | Deposit system + pre-screening + group culture      |
| **High CAC**                   | Unit economics collapse       | Organic-first, referral incentives, partnerships    |
| **Easy to copy**               | Commoditized if successful    | Brand, facilitator quality, network effects         |
| **Unclear monetization**       | Can't sustain growth          | Clear pricing from Pilot, willing-to-pay validation |
| **Facilitator bottleneck**     | Can't scale                   | Training, templates, systems documentation          |

## 7. Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors

- **Peanut:** Friend-matching app; lacks consistency
- **Bumble BFF:** App-based; still transactional
- **Meetup.com:** Consistent but loose, no cohort model
- **Co-living (Roam, Selina):** Social programming included but expensive

### Competitive Advantages

1. **Cohort model:** Unique consistency + bonding
2. **Activity integration:** Not just networking; real experiences
3. **City expertise:** Deep local knowledge of Amsterdam
4. **Community-first:** Not monetizing users directly for data/ads

---

## 8. Metrics That Matter

### Recruitment Phase

- Website conversion rate (email signups)
- CAC per channel
- Signup velocity

### Execution Phase

- Attendance rate (target: 80%+)
- Participant satisfaction (NPS)
- Friendship formation rate (survey: "formed meaningful friendships?")

### Post-Program

- Cohort retention (still in touch after 6 weeks)
- Willingness to pay
- Net Promoter Score (NPS)
- Referral rate

### Long-term

- Cost per friend formed
- Year 1 revenue
- Unit economics validation
- Foundation for scaling

### Scaling to 50 Cities (Year 3+)

**Conservative Estimate (50 cities with average market size):**

- Average participants per city: 835 (based on 10-city average)
- Total participants: 41,750
- Total revenue: €13,126,200
- **Brand owner revenue: €6,563,100**

### Key Insights from Market Research

1. **Market Size Variation:** Cities range from 90K (Copenhagen) to 1.35M (London) target markets
2. **Penetration Rates:** 0.2% is realistic for startup/tech hubs with high expat populations
3. **Revenue Concentration:** Top 3 cities (London, Berlin, Madrid) generate 60% of total revenue
4. **Scalability:** Smaller cities like Zurich and Copenhagen still profitable but lower volume

### Key Success Factors

- **Ambassador Quality:** Local market expertise and execution capability
- **Platform Efficiency:** Scalable systems for operations across cities
- **Brand Consistency:** Maintaining quality standards across all markets
- **Network Effects:** Cross-city alumni connections and referrals
