# New Cohorts - Key Business Dimensions

## 1. Value Proposition

### What We Offer
A structured 6-week friendship program that delivers lasting connections through intentional weekly experiences with a consistent group.

### Why It Works
- **Psychology:** Repeated exposure + shared activities = Friendship formation
- **Differentiation:** Consistency where other apps are random; intentionality where meetups are casual
- **Validation:** Based on proven cohort model (universities, bootcamps, church groups)

---

## 2. Target Customer (Global, Starting in Amsterdam)

### Primary Persona: The Relocated Professional
- **Demographics:** Ages 25-35, recently relocated to any major city (0-12 months)
- **Psychographics:** Seeking genuine friendships, willing to commit weekly, exploring new city
- **Problem:** Lonely, have apps but no real friends, limited time to invest in social exploration
- **Budget:** €50-200 for 6-week program (varies by city/market)
- **Universal need:** The fundamental problem is location-independent—anyone who moves experiences this

### Secondary Personas (Also Universal)
- **Career Relocators:** Moved for work with spouse/partner who has colleagues they don't
- **Life Transitioners:** Recently single or post-breakup, old friend groups unavailable
- **Remote Workers:** Moved for lifestyle, work from home, lack organic social opportunities
- **Locals Seeking Refresh:** City natives in stagnant social circles wanting reset

### Amsterdam as Pilot Validation
- English-speaking, international demographic (validates model)
- High concentration of relocators and expats
- Proof-of-concept before scaling to other cities
- Each new city will have same personas, different cultural nuances

## 3. Revenue Model

### Primary: Participant Fees
- **Price Point:** €120 per person for 6-week program

  - Mid-case projection: €880 signups/year = €105k gross (single city)

### Secondary: Future Options
- **Sponsorships:** Co-working spaces, activity venues, relocation services
- **Franchising:** EU expansion (10 cities = €2.2M potential franchisor revenue)
- **Premium Tiers:** VIP cohorts with additional perks

## 5. Unit Economics - Per City (Model Applicable to Any City)

*Note: Amsterdam is our pilot validation market. These economics are designed to be repeatable across cities globally.*

### Assumptions
- Price: €120 per person
- Signups: 50 in Year 1 (phased cohorts)
- Attendance rate: 75% average (attrition happens)
- Activity costs: €60 per person per program
- Facilitator time: 10 hrs/cohort @ €30/hr = €300

### Per-Cohort Economics (15 people)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue (15 × €120) | €1,800 |
| Activity costs (15 × €60) | €900 |
| Facilitation (10 hrs × €30) | €300 |
| Overhead (venue, comms, admin) | €200 |
| **Net per cohort** | **€400** |

### Annual (4 cohorts, 50 total signups)
| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Revenue (50 × €120) | €6,000 |
| Operating costs | ~€3,400 |
| **Net profit** | **€2,600** |

**Note:** This unit economics repeats per city. Scale to multiple cities via franchising, regional partnerships, or platform operations.

## 6. Key Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Chicken-egg (low signups)** | Low revenue, unviable cohorts | Paid acquisition test + partnerships + content |
| **Flakiness (low attendance)** | Breaks model | Deposit system + pre-screening + group culture |
| **High CAC** | Unit economics collapse | Organic-first, referral incentives, partnerships |
| **Easy to copy** | Commoditized if successful | Brand, facilitator quality, network effects |
| **Unclear monetization** | Can't sustain growth | Clear pricing from Pilot, willing-to-pay validation |
| **Facilitator bottleneck** | Can't scale | Training, templates, systems documentation |

## 7. Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors
- **Peanut:** Friend-matching app; lacks consistency
- **Bumble BFF:** App-based; still transactional
- **Meetup.com:** Consistent but loose, no cohort model
- **Co-living (Roam, Selina):** Social programming included but expensive

### Competitive Advantages
1. **Cohort model:** Unique consistency + bonding
2. **Activity integration:** Not just networking; real experiences
3. **City expertise:** Deep local knowledge of Amsterdam
4. **Community-first:** Not monetizing users directly for data/ads

## 8. Metrics That Matter

### Recruitment Phase
- Website conversion rate (email signups)
- CAC per channel
- Signup velocity

### Execution Phase
