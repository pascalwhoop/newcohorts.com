# The Concept

A cohort-based friendship program in Amsterdam for people who've relocated and want to build lasting
relationships. Inspired by university cohorts - the same group meets weekly for 6 weeks doing varied
activities that foster genuine connections.

Core Principle: Consistent time together with the same people creates the conditions for lasting
friendships.

# Target Personas

## Primary: The New Arrival

Age: Mid-20s to mid-30s

Situation: Recently moved to Amsterdam, minimal social network

Motivation: Build genuine friendships, explore the city, available for weekly commitment

Time availability: High (new to city, fewer existing commitments)

## Secondary Personas Worth Exploring

Career relocators: Moved with spouse for work, spouse has colleagues but they don't

Life transitioners: Recently single, old friend groups tied to ex-partner

Remote workers: Moved to Amsterdam, work from home, lack organic social opportunities

Locals seeking refresh: Amsterdam natives wanting to break out of stagnant social circles

# Strengths

Real pain point: Loneliness in new cities is massive and underserved

Forced consistency: Weekly commitment creates bonding conditions that most friendship apps lack

Low initial investment: Can validate with almost no money upfront

Built-in word-of-mouth: Successful cohorts become evangelists

Amsterdam is perfect: International city, English-speaking, constant influx of expats

# Weaknesses & Risks

Chicken-and-egg problem: Need critical mass for first cohort (12-20 people minimum)

Flakiness risk: People dropping out breaks the model

Unclear value proposition: Make friends sounds vague - needs sharper positioning

No moat: Easy to copy if it works

Facilitator burden: Who runs these? How much time? Does it scale?

Monetization unclear: Don't know yet if or how this makes money

# Ick-factor

Ego

Exclusivity?

Upsell / cross sell

Loners → loneliness problem solver

Friendship program

Neediness

Obvious paid partnership / business (giant advertisement)

# It-factor

Building communities → that’s what builds friendships

Consistency

A great way to get to know the city

## Phase 3: Planning (Week 3-4)

### Design the 6-Week Program

Select activities (see activity list below)

Mix energy levels: high-energy weeks plus chill weeks

Alternate doing activities and talking activities

Observe: Who shows up? What works? What doesn't?

Mid-cohort check-in (week 3): Quick survey

### After Cohort

Exit survey: Would they recommend? What changed?

Measure: How many formed lasting friendships?

Ask: Would they pay? How much?

Document learnings for Cohort 2

# Open Questions to Validate

## Duration

Is 6 weeks the right length? Research: How long does it take to form friendships?

Alternative: 4 weeks (easier commitment) or 8 weeks (deeper bonds)

## Monetization

Should participants pay? If so, how much?

Options: 50-100 euro for 6 weeks? Pay-what-you-can? Free pilot then paid?

Should it be non-profit with proceeds to charity?

Could sponsors cover costs (co-working spaces, activity venues)

## Scale

If this works, how do you run multiple cohorts simultaneously?

Do you need trained facilitators?

Can it work in other cities?

## Commitment

How do you ensure people show up?

Require deposit that's refunded if they attend 5 out of 6 weeks?

Interview process to filter for serious people?

# Competition Research

Do this AFTER you have 10 signups - don't let research become procrastination

When ready, analyze:

Peanut app, Bumble BFF, [Meetup.com](http://Meetup.com), We3 app

Adult friendship programs in other cities

Co-living spaces with social programming (Roam, Selina)

GirlCrew, City Socializer

Ask: What do they do well? What's missing? How is our cohort model different?

# Success Metrics - Pilot

Website live within 1 week

## Engagement

80 percent plus attendance rate across 6 weeks

90 percent plus say they'd recommend to a friend

## Outcomes

50 percent plus formed at least 2 new meaningful friendships

60 percent plus plan to stay in touch with cohort members

70 percent plus would be willing to pay for future cohorts

## Learning

Clear understanding of which activities worked best

Validated or invalidated pricing willingness

Identified any missing personas

Documented what surprised us

# The Absolute Smallest First Step (Today)

Decide together:

1. When do you want Cohort 1 to start? (Pick a Monday 4-5 weeks from now)
2. Who does what? (Assign Person A and B tasks above)
3. Set check-in: Tomorrow same time to review progress

Then Person A: Spend 2 hours building the website tonight

Then Person B: Spend 1 hour joining all recruitment channels tonight

That's it. Don't overthink. Ship the imperfect website. Post the imperfect message. Real is better
than perfect.
