# What is New Cohorts?

A 6-week friendship program where the same group of 12 people meets twice weekly for curated
activities designed to build genuine, lasting connections.

Think university dorm life, but for adults who are serious about building their Amsterdam community.

## Program Structure

**Organized Events (Saturdays)** Curated by us - activities designed for maximum connection and
bonding

**Peer Events (Thursdays)**  
Chosen by your cohort - personal passions and interests shared with the group

- **Curated Activities**: Thoughtfully designed experiences that actually help people connect and
  bond.
- **Weekly Commitment**: Twice weekly commitment. Clear schedule, clear expectations, clear results.

# Meet the Founders

We're Pascal and Patrick, two Amsterdam expats who experienced the same challenge: building
meaningful friendships in a new city.

After trying every app and meetup, we realized the problem wasn't Amsterdam—it was the approach.
Real friendships need consistency, shared experiences, and time.

So we created New Cohorts: the university dorm experience for adults who are serious about building
their Amsterdam community.

## Our Mission

To make Amsterdam feel like home by helping people build the deep, lasting friendships that
transform a city from a place you live to a place you belong.
