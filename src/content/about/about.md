# What is New Cohorts?

A structured 6-week program where **the same group** meets weekly to do varied activities together.
No awkward one-off meetups. No endless swiping. Just consistent time with real people building
genuine friendships.

Think of it like your university cohort — but for people new to Amsterdam.

## How It Works

**Same people, every week, for 6 weeks**

- Consistent time together with the same people creates the conditions for lasting friendships
- Small cohorts of 12-20 people (big enough to meet diverse people, small enough that everyone
  actually connects)
- Weekly commitment ensures the bonding conditions that most friendship apps lack

**Research shows that forming close friendships requires:**

1. **Proximity** — being in the same place
2. **Repeated contact** — seeing each other regularly
3. **Shared experiences** — doing things together

Our 6-week cohort model creates all three conditions intentionally.

# The 6-Week Program

## Week 1: Kickoff Dinner

Deep conversation starter — people need to get comfortable. Group dinner at a casual restaurant with
introductions and expectation-setting.

## Weeks 2-5: Building Bonds

Variety of interactivity types balancing 1-on-1s, group casual activities, and deep conversations.

**Sample Activities:**

- Creative workshops (pottery, painting, cocktail making)
- Active socials (bowling, mini golf, board games)
- Cultural exploration (museums, walking tours, food market crawls)
- Collaborative challenges (escape rooms, cooking classes, pub quizzes)

## Week 6: Closing Celebration

Reflect on the experience and exchange contacts for ongoing friendships.

**Sample closing events:**

- Picnic in Vondelpark
- Potluck dinner
- Drinks at a cozy bar

# Why This Works

This isn't just another meetup app or random social event. It's a **structured approach to solving
the real problem: building lasting friendships takes time and consistency.**

Real friendships emerge from:

- **Forced consistency** — weekly commitment creates bonding conditions
- **Shared experience** — diverse activities foster genuine connections
- **Time together** — 6 weeks allows relationships to deepen naturally

# About Us

We moved to Amsterdam ourselves and experienced firsthand how challenging it is to build genuine
friendships as an adult in a new city. We tried the apps, went to the meetups, and still felt like
something was missing.

That's when we realized: **consistency is the missing ingredient.**

So we're creating the friendship program we wish existed when we first arrived.

# Frequently Asked Questions

**What if I can't make one of the weeks?**  
We understand life happens. We ask that you commit to at least 5 out of 6 weeks.

**Do I need to be new to Amsterdam?**  
No! While we designed this for newcomers, anyone looking to expand their social circle is welcome.

**Is this free?**  
For our pilot cohort, we ask for €99-120 to cover activities and coordination. You'll also pay for
your own meals and activity tickets as they occur.

**What if I'm introverted?**  
Perfect! The structure takes pressure off. You're not expected to be the life of the party — just be
yourself and show up.

**How do I know people will actually commit?**  
We're carefully selecting participants who demonstrate genuine interest and availability. Once your
cohort gets started, you'll want to show up!
