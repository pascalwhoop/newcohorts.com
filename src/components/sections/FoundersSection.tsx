            Moving to a new city can feel exciting—and isolating. We're building structured, 
            time-boxed cohorts so newcomers land with an instant circle, a shared calendar, 
            and a clear path from "I just arrived" to "I belong here." It's personal for both of us.

            Belonging shouldn't be a matter of luck. With a clear cohort, a six-week shared agenda, 
            and lightweight accountability, anyone can plug into a city's social fabric fast. 
            We're here to make that first month feel like month twelve—fewer awkward cold starts, 
            more meaningful reps together.
