always use todo.txt to keep track of your tasks. add new tasks, mark completed tasks. Group larger
topics into "packages" through a h2 markdown heading.

Finally let's have "Epics" in a h1 heading. e.g. major new capabilities, features, etc.

format:

```

## Package Name
- [ ] Task description
- [x] Task description
- [ ] task with a theme #design
- [x] setup #CI


## Another Package Name
- [ ] Task description
- [x] Task description
- [ ] task with a theme #design
- [x] setup #CI

```
