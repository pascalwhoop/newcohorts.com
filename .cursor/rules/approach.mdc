## TODO

always use todo.txt to keep track of your tasks. add new tasks, mark completed tasks. Group larger
topics into "packages" through a h2 markdown heading.

Finally let's have "Epics" in a h1 heading. e.g. major new capabilities, features, etc.

@todo.txt

format:

```

## Package Name
- [ ] Task description
- [x] Task description
- [ ] task with a theme #design
- [x] setup #CI


## Another Package Name
- [ ] Task description
- [x] Task description
- [ ] task with a theme #design
- [x] setup #CI

```

## Git commit

`gcp` = git commit & git push

## What to run and what not

- Never try running the dev server unless I ask you. I RUN the server!
- never just make large library choices without asking me.
- When in doubt ask for guidance.
